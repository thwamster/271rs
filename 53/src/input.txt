Hydrogen is a chemical element with the symbol H and atomic number 1. It is the lightest and most abundant element, constituting about 75% of all normal matter. The Sun is mainly hydrogen in a plasma state. Under standard conditions, hydrogen is a gas of diatomic molecules with the formula H2; it is colorless, odorless, non-toxic and highly combustible. On Earth, hydrogen can exist in its gaseous state and in molecular forms, such as with oxygen in water (H2O). The most common isotope of hydrogen (1H) consists of one proton, one electron and no neutrons. Hydrogen gas was first produced artificially by the reaction of acids with metals. Henry Cavendish, in 1766â€“1781, identified hydrogen gas as a distinct substance and discovered its property of producing water when burned; its name means water-former in Greek. Its main industrial uses include fossil-fuel processing and ammonia production for fertilizer. Emerging uses for hydrogen include the use of fuel cells to generate electricity. (Full article...) \n
